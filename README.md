As part of my internship, I was given the task of developing a C program that demonstrates various linked list operations, including insertion, deletion, and traversal. The objective of the task was to gain practical experience with dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation—key components of low-level programming and data structure implementation.

I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my development environment, taking advantage of its user-friendly interface, integrated terminal, and support for C language extensions. The project required designing and implementing a singly linked list using structures and pointers in C, allowing users to interact with the list through a menu-driven program.

The program supported insertion of nodes at the beginning, at the end, and at any specific position within the list. It also included deletion operations that allowed removal of nodes from the start, end, or a given position. Additionally, a traversal function was implemented to display the current elements in the linked list, helping visualize the structure and flow of the data. Each operation was designed with modular functions to keep the code organized and maintainable.

One of the key challenges I faced during this project was the correct management of pointers—especially during insertions and deletions at specific positions. Pointer mismanagement often resulted in segmentation faults and unexpected behavior. To overcome these hurdles, I utilized ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot as troubleshooting and learning tools. These platforms provided suggestions, explanations, and code snippets that helped me better understand the root of the issues and implement the correct logic.

Edge case handling was another area I focused on. For example, I made sure the program could manage operations on an empty list, prevent deletion from invalid positions, and maintain the integrity of the list structure throughout multiple modifications. I implemented necessary validation checks and included clear, user-friendly error messages to ensure robustness and improve usability.

This project gave me hands-on experience with dynamic memory management using malloc() and free(), teaching me how to allocate and deallocate memory properly to avoid leaks and crashes. I also developed a stronger grasp of how data is stored and manipulated in memory through pointers, and how different nodes in a linked list are connected and traversed.

The final outcome was a reliable, efficient, and interactive C program capable of performing key linked list operations with accuracy. The task provided a strong foundation for understanding how abstract data structures are implemented in real-world applications, and how modular design helps in maintaining and scaling codebases.

In conclusion, the project significantly enhanced my practical knowledge of data structures, improved my debugging and coding efficiency, and introduced me to helpful AI tools that assist in development. This experience has made me more confident in handling complex programming challenges and laid the groundwork for future projects involving more advanced data structures.
